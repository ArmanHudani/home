			<h2> About Kyle Lowry </h2>
			<p> Kyle Lowry is a professional basketball player who is currently playing for the Miami Heat. Throughout his career 
					Kyle has been an all star 6 times and won the NBA title in 2019 with the Toronto Raptors. He was also named All NBA 
					third team in 2016 and was a member of the US national team in the 2016 Olympics. Before coming to the NBA Lowry played 2
					seasons of college basketball with the Villanova Wildcats. Lowry was picked 24th overall in the 2006 draft while starting of 
					with the Memphis Grizzles, then getting traded to the Houston Rockets, then to the Toronto Raptors, and finally to the Miami 
					Heat. During his time with the Toronto Raptors, he helped them reach the playoffs for the first time in seven years and also 
					helped them win the an Atlantic Division title. 2 years later in the 2015 and 16 season, Lowry had led the raptors to 56 wins
					which was the most ever won by the franchise. That same year, the raptors had also reached the Eastern Conference Finals for 
					the first time. I believe that Kyle Lowry is the greatest raptor of All Time due to the fact that he has turned around the 
					franchise since the day he arrived in Toronto.
