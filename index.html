		<p> Basketball is formally a sport that is played between 2 teams. It was invented by <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/James-Naismith" style="color:red">
			James Naismith</a> who was a canadian physical education instructor on December 1st, 1891. The reason why the sport is called &ldquo;basketball&rdquo;
			is because the first ever game was played with peach baskets. The only struggle was that anytime someone scored&sbquo; it was a pain to retrieve 
			the ball every single time so a modification was made so that the bottom of the peach baskets were cut which lets the balls freely roll out from 
			the basket. Originally&sbquo; either 5&sbquo; 7 or 9 players could be on the court from each team but this was enventually permenantly changed to 5 players from each team 
			in 1895. Some other countries outside of Cananda and the USA to be introduced to sport was France in 1893&sbquo; England in 1894&sbquo; and countries such as 
			Australia&sbquo; India&sbquo; and China in the 1900s. A modification that was essential to the game of basketball we know today is the addition of a backboard. This 
			change was first put in place to make sure that spectators do not interfere with the game. After the success of the wooden backboards, glass ones were made official 
			in 1908. The first balls used to play the sport was soccer balls and this was used for two whole years until the first basketball was made in 1894. The first ever
			college basketball game ever played was played on January 18, 1896 between the university of Iowa and The university of Chicago. The score was 15 to 12 and the
			university of Chicago won. The reason why basketball become more and more pouplar in the 90s was due to cable tv which become more heavily used in the 90s. Alongside 
			the use of cable tv, greats such as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michael-Jordan" style="color:red">Michael Jordan</a>&sbquo; <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Karl-Malone"
			style="color:red">Karl Malone</a> and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Shaquille-ONeal" style="color:red">Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal</a> also helped boost the exposure 
			of the sport making it equivalent to sports such as football and baseball. This exposure not only helped popularize basketball&sbquo; but it also helped to establish another area 
			which was professional basketball or we know it today as the NBA.</p>

		<img src = "images/NBA.jpg" alt="pictur of nba logo" width = "300"/>
		<p> The reason why the NBA is even a thing today is due to the merger in 1949 between <a href="https://basketball.fandom.com/wiki/Basketball_Association_of_America" style="color:red">BAA</a> which stands for the Basketball 
			Association of America and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_League_(United_States)#:~:text=The%20National%20Basketball%20League%20(NBL,National%20Basketball%20Association%20(NBA) ." style="color:red">NBL</a> 
			which stands National Basketball League. This merger took place in order to make sure that the sport was financially stable which it was struggling to before 
			the merger. After the merger&sbquo; the name was changed to the National Basketball Association and has stayed till this date. An essential rule created by the NBA was that every team would be able 
			to pick a senior in college to add to their team but the catch was that lower-standings teams would be able to choose first which helped to equalize the league. Some other rule changes made by the 
			NBA included the 24 second shot clock violation which essentially gave a team 24 seconds to make a basket before it would be the other team&rsquo; posession and the backcourt foul which which entititles any player to recieve 
			2 free throws if he is fouled in the backcourt. After overcoming many struggles&sbquo; the NBA was again hit with a storm known as the <a href="https://abaliveaction.com/about-the-aba/" style="color:red">ABA</a> which stood for
			the American Basketball Association launched in 1968 and was lead by commissioner <a href="https://www.nba.com/75/player/george-mikan-600012" style="color:red">George Mikan</a> who was a former Los Angeles Lakers player.
			Another victory for the NBA happened when it acquired 4 teams from the ABA in 1976 the same year it broke apart. The NBA is consisted of 30 teams that are divided into 2 major sections which is the Eatsern and Western conference 
			and then are divided into 6 different sub-sections: the Atlantic Division&sbquo; the Central Division&sbquo;the Southeast Division&sbquo; the Southwest Division&sbquo; the Northwest Division&sbquo; and the Pacific Division. 
			The most important part of NBA season is when the playoffs arrive which happens around late April and ends in late June. The top 8 teams from both the Eastern and Western Conference play each other in order to find out who will become
			the NBA champion. Salaries in the NBA are very different that some players can be making close to a million dollars a year while players such as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Stephen-Curry" style="color:red">
			Stephen Curry</a> and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/LeBron-James" style="color:red">Lebron James</a> make around 40 million dollars a year.</p>

		<p> Each NBA conatains 4 quarters that are 12 minutes long. If teams go to overtime&sbquo; quarters then become 5 mins long and
			continue on until one team ends up with more points. If a player is fouled&sbquo; the clock is then stopped until the play is 
			resumed meaning that games take around 2 hours to complete. For uniform&sbquo; the standard includes a pair of shorts and a
			jersey with the player&rsquo;s allocated number. Players tend to wear high top sneakers as they provide extra ankle support.
			On the court&sbquo; five players from each team paly each other while substitutions can only be made when a play is stopped. 
			A team also consists of a coach and other helpers such as assistant coaches&sbquo; managers&sbquo; statisticians&sbquo; doctors and trainers.
			Equipment for a basketball games is pretty standard as it consists of a ball and a court that contains baskets at opposite ends.
			Things like scoreboards&sbquo; whistle operated stop clock systems and alternating possesion arrows are needed for competitive games such
			as the NBA. A regular NBA court is 29 by 15 meters long and most courts consist of wood flooring constructed from maple planks.
			Next&sbquo; the rim is made up of steel and is 18 inches in diamter while being 10 feet above the court. The official size of a basketball
			for men is 29.5 inches in circumference and weighs 22 oz which is roughly 620 grams. To advance the ball toward the basket&sbquo; it may be 
			passed between players&sbquo; thrown&sbquo; tapped&sbquo; rolled&sbquo; or dribbled but must stay within the court at all time. Some dribbling violations 
			include traveling&sbqui; double dribble&sbquo; and carrying the ball. In a game&sbquo; each team has 24 seconds to obtain a point before it becomes the
			other team&rsquo;s ball and this is known as the shot clock violation. A personal foul is commited by a player when they attempt to unfairly 
			disadvantage an opponent. Players who are fouled either receive free throws or get to inbound the ball from the sideline. 
			Referees are responsibe for giving out fouls to the players. Players who exhibit unsportsmanlike conduct may be given a 
			a technical foul which is a second category of fouls. Next&sbquo; a blatant foul involving unecessary physcial contanct is called 
			a flagrant foul. Finally&sbquo; if a team exceeds the limit of fouls&sbquo; the opposing team will be awarded with 1 or 2 free throws
			on every foul commited for said period. </p>
