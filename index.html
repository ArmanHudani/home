		<!-- This paragraph section will give an overview about how basketball was created and how it spread around the world -->
		<p> Basketball is formally a sport that is played between 2 teams. It was invented by <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/James-Naismith" class="red">
			James Naismith</a> who was a canadian physical education instructor on December 1st&sbquo; 1891. The reason why the sport is called &ldquo;basketball&rdquo;
			is because the first ever game was played with peach baskets. The only struggle was that anytime someone scored&sbquo; it was a pain to retrieve 
			the ball every single time so a modification was made so that the bottom of the peach baskets were cut which lets the balls freely roll out from 
			the basket. Originally&sbquo; either 5&sbquo; 7 or 9 players could be on the court from each team but this was enventually permenantly changed to 5 players from each team 
			in 1895. Some other countries outside of Cananda and the USA to be introduced to sport was France in 1893&sbquo; England in 1894&sbquo; and countries such as 
			Australia&sbquo; India&sbquo; and China in the 1900s. A modification that was essential to the game of basketball we know today is the addition of a backboard. This 
			change was first put in place to make sure that spectators do not interfere with the game. After the success of the wooden backboards&sbquo; glass ones were made official 
			in 1908. The first balls used to play the sport was soccer balls and this was used for two whole years until the first basketball was made in 1894. The first ever
			college basketball game ever played was played on January 18&sbquo; 1896 between the university of Iowa and The university of Chicago. The score was 15 to 12 and the
			university of Chicago won. The reason why basketball become more and more pouplar in the 90s was due to cable tv which become more heavily used in the 90s. Alongside 
			the use of cable tv&sbquo; greats such as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michael-Jordan" class="red">Michael Jordan</a>&sbquo; <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Karl-Malone"
			class="red">Karl Malone</a> and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Shaquille-ONeal" class="red">Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal</a> also helped boost the exposure 
			of the sport making it equivalent to sports such as football and baseball. This exposure not only helped popularize basketball&sbquo; but it also helped to establish another area 
			which was professional basketball or we know it today as the NBA.</p>

		<!-- This paragraph section will give the viewers the origin story about the NBA and the obstacles its had to face in order to become what it is today --> 
		<p> The reason why the NBA is even a thing today is due to the merger in 1949 between the <a href="https://basketball.fandom.com/wiki/Basketball_Association_of_America" class="red">BAA</a> which stands for the Basketball 
			Association of America and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_League_(United_States)#:~:text=The%20National%20Basketball%20League%20(NBL,National%20Basketball%20Association%20(NBA)." class="red">NBL</a> 
			which stands National Basketball League. This merger took place in order to make sure that the sport was financially stable which it was struggling to do before 
			the merger. After the merger&sbquo; the name was changed to the National Basketball Association and has stayed till this date. An essential rule created by the NBA was that every team would be able 
			to pick a senior in college to add to their team but the catch was that lower-standings teams would be able to choose first which helped to equalize the league. Some other rule changes made by the 
			NBA included the 24 second shot clock violation which essentially gave a team 24 seconds to make a basket before it would be the other team&rsquo; posession and the backcourt foul which which entititles any player to recieve 
			2 free throws if he is fouled in the backcourt. After overcoming many struggles&sbquo; the NBA was again hit with a storm known as the <a href="https://abaliveaction.com/about-the-aba/" class="red">ABA</a> which stood for
			the American Basketball Association launched in 1968 and was lead by commissioner <a href="https://www.nba.com/75/player/george-mikan-600012" class="red">George Mikan</a> who was a former Los Angeles Lakers player.
			Another victory for the NBA happened when it acquired 4 teams from the ABA in 1976 the same year it broke apart. The NBA is consisted of 30 teams that are divided into 2 major sections which is the Eatsern and Western conference 
			and then are divided into 6 different sub-sections: the Atlantic Division&sbquo; the Central Division&sbquo;the Southeast Division&sbquo; the Southwest Division&sbquo; the Northwest Division&sbquo; and the Pacific Division. 
			The most important part of NBA season is when the playoffs arrive which happens around late April and ends in late June. The top 8 teams from both the Eastern and Western Conference play each other in order to find out who will become
			the NBA champion. Salaries in the NBA are very different that some players can be making close to a million dollars a year while players such as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Stephen-Curry" class="red">
			Stephen Curry</a> and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/LeBron-James" class="red">Lebron James</a> make around 40 million dollars a year. A rule that drastically changed the NBA draft was in 2005 when the it was stated 
			that any players that enter the draft must be 19 years of age and must spend at least one year in college or on any other international basketball team before entering the NBA. </p>

		<!-- This paragraph section will give the website viewers most of the information needed to play a game of basketball -->
		<p> Throughout the game of basketball&sbquo; the most common shape for the court is a rectangle and the an the sizes of the court depends on the use. For example&sbquo; courts used for competitive basketnall are most of the times bigger than  <!-- This paragraph section will give the website viewers most of the information needed to play a game of basketball -->
			courts in schools. Typically&sbquo; the average size of a court is usually around 15 metres by 29 metres. The most standard basketball is a size 7 basketball which usually measure 29.5&rsquo;&rsquo; in circumference and have a weight around 22 ounces with a leather cover surrounding the . 
			An essential part of a basketball court is the markings that are on the floor. These include the three-point line&sbquo; the free-throw line&sbquo; baselines&sbquo; and sidelines and these are important as without them&sbquo; you wouldn&rsquo;t know where to start a games&sbquo;
			what places are considered out of bounds and the amount of points each basket is worth. In essence&sbquo; if it wasn&rsquo;t for the lines&sbquo; the game of basketball wouldn&rsquo;t be possible. All throughout NBA history&sbquo; the rules and guidelines have 
			been based on one major aspect which is <a href = "https://naismithbasketballfoundation.com/about-basketball/naismiths-rules-for-basketball/" class = "red">&ldquo;Naismith&rsquo;s 5 principles&rdquo;</a>. The rules that are included are that a player must
			must not run with the ball&sbquo; there should be no personal contact from players&sbquo; a player must not be prohibated from getting the ball when it&rsquo;s in play and finally&sbquo; each game of basketball should contain a basket where players are able to 
			attain points by scoring buckets. People who call out players for various fouls and unsportsmanlike behaviours are called referees. Referees make sure that each game is played fairly and that both teams are abiding by the rules. Alongside the referees&sbquo;
			scorekeepers and timers are set in place in order to make sure that each game runs smoothly. Before the introduction of the three-point line in 1979&sbquo; every basket made no matter the distance was always worth only two points. This would mean at times&sbquo; 
			players would be making shots from near the half court line and would only be recieving 2 points which when I think about now sounds mind-boggling. In basketball&sbquo; the main way to bring the ball up the court is by dribbling it or by passing it forward to your
			teammate. According to prior NBA rules&sbquo; a foul is when a player commits illegal personal contact towrads another player. If a player is fouled but is not attempting a basket the play is stopped and the fouled team get to inbound the ball for the sidelines.
			If a player gets fouled while attempting a shot and they miss they are awarded 2 free-throws but&sbquo; if the player makes the shot then gets fouled it is called an <a href = "https://basketballword.com/and-one-explained/" class= "red">&ldquo;And 1&rdquo; </a> and 
			the player is then awarded with one extra free-throw. Other violations include travelling which is essentially called on a player when they take more than 2 steps&sbquo; a double dribble which is called on a player when they dribble a second time after stopping their first dribble&sbquo;
			and a 5 second violation which is called on an offensive player who does not pass&sbquo; shoot&sbquo; or dribble the within 5 seconds of being tightly guraded by a defender. There are a wide variety of terms used in the game of basketball&sbquo; but some of the more 
			common ones include jump ball which when the referee tosses the ball up between 2 players at the start of each game in order to see which team gains possesion of the ball&sbquo; a rebound which is essentially the action of retrieving the basketball after a player has either
			missed a field goal or free throw&sbquo; and pivoting which is when a player stands still with the ball and steps with one foot while the foot that is still on the ground is called the pivot foot. </p>
