		<h2 id="TheHistory" class="ball"> About Kyle Lowry </h2> <!-- This paragraph section will give the viewers of the website a small synopsis about Kyle Lowry in order to better know him -->
		<p> Kyle Lowry is a professional basketball player who is currently playing for the Miami Heat. His spouse is Ayahna Cornish and they
			have two kids named Kameron and Karter Lowry. Throughout his career&sbquo; Kyle has been an all&ndash;star 6 times and won the NBA title in 2019 
			with the Toronto Raptors. He was also named All NBA third team in 2016 and was a member of the US team in the 2016 Olympics. Before coming to the NBA Lowry played 2
			seasons of college basketball with the Villanova Wildcats. Lowry was picked 24th overall in the 2006 draft while starting off 
			with the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Memphis-Grizzlies" class="red">Memphis Grizzlies</a>&sbquo; 
			then getting traded to the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Houston-Rockets" class="red">Houston Rockets</a>&sbquo; 
			then to the Toronto Raptors&sbquo; and finally to the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Miami-Heat" class="red">Miami Heat</a>
			During his time with the Toronto Raptors&sbquo; he helped them reach the playoffs for the first time in seven years and also helped 
			them win the Atlantic Division title. 2 years later in the 2015/16 season&sbquo; Lowry had led the Raptors to 56 wins which was 
			the most ever won by the franchise. That same year&sbquo; the raptors had also reached the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time. 
			I believe that Kyle Lowry is the greatest raptor of All Time since he has turned around the franchise the day he arrived in Toronto. </p>

		<h3> Childhood </h3> <!-- This section will give the viewers an overview on how Kyle Lowry has become the person he is today --> 
		<p> Kyle Lowry was born on March 25th&sbquo; 1986 in Philadelphia&sbquo; Pennsylvania. He is the son of Lonnie Lowry Sr. and Marie Hollaway
			and is the brother of Lonnie Lowry Jr. His childhood was pretty rough due to the fact that his parents were going through some
			problems and also because of the violence in Philadelphia. To provide for both of her sons&sbquo; Lowry&rsquo;s mother had to work
			2 jobs in order to put food on the table. Basketball helped Lowry to get his mind away from the problems that were happening in his 
			life. His older brother was one of his big supporters helping him learn how to dribble and shoot while helping him stay focused on the 
			game. </p> 
		<h3> High School </h3>
		<p>	Lowry&rsquo;s basketball skills were tremendous that they caught the eye of assistant coach Dave Distal. He helped to convince Kyle 
			in attending Cardinal Dougherty High School which he attended shortly after. While on their basketball team&sbquo; Lowry played the
			point guard position. Due to his awesome skills&sbquo; Lowry was rated as a 5&ndash;star recruit and won the High School Player of the Year in 2004. </p>
		<h3> College </h3>	
		<p>	After high school&sbquo; Lowry went to Villanova University for 2 years. In his first college basketball season&sbquo; he played in 24 games
			averaging about 8 points with 3 rebounds and 2 assists. His performance helped him get a spot on the Big East All-Rookie team. In his 
			second year of college&sbquo; Lowry increased his games played by 9 and also increased all his stats by averaging 11 points with 4 rebounds and 
			4 assists. Due to the fact that this was his best performance yet&sbquo; Lowry again earned a spot in the First Team All-Big 5 and in 
			the All-Big East Second Team.</p>

		<h3> Team 1: Memphis Grizzlies </h3> <!-- This section will give information about how Lowrys basketball career came to be -->
		<p> Lowry started his basketball career by getting drafted 24th by the Memphis Grizzlies. Sadly in his rookie season&sbquo; he was only able to 
			play 10 games due to the fact suffered a fractured wrist. The next season games&ndash;wise was statistically amazing for Lowry as he played in all 82 
			games which was the most games played for that season by any player. The season after was a challenging one for Lowry due to the fact that he was competing 
			with the Grizzlie&rsquo;s other point guard <a href="https://infofamouspeople.com/famous/mike-conley.htm" class="red">Mike Conley Jr.</a>
			to see who would receive the most minutes as a point guard but the addition of a new coach helped Conley to secure the position. </p>
		<h3> Team 2: Houston Rockets </h3>	
		<p>	Lowry was then traded to the Houston Rockets in 2009 and in his first season with them made it to the playoffs for the first time in his career. Due to a good   
			performance in the 2010/2011 season&sbquo; Lowry gained some popularity and in the same season was the first Rockets player to attain a triple&ndash;double 
			since 2003. This accomplishment helped him to get the Western Player of the Week. The next season&sbquo; the Rockets were trying to get some younger
			players and in order to make sure that this is possible&sbquo; they traded Lowry to the Toronto Raptors for some draft picks and forward Gary Forbes. </p>
		<h3> Team 3: Toronto Raptors </h3>	
		<p>	Once he got to toronto&sbquo; he was only able to play 3 games until he was injured again. This did not stop him as with the addition of coach Masai
			Ujiri in 2013 and <a href="https://sportytell.com/basketball/demar-derozan-biography-facts-childhood-net-worth-life/" class="red">DeMar DeRozan</a>
			in 2014 the raptors were able to change their luck and made it to the playoffs that same year. Sadly their playoff run came to an end when they lost 
			to the Brooklyn Nets in the first round. Next season Lowry continued to dominate and for his performance was named Eastern Conference Player of the Month.
			It was also the first time he was an All&ndash;Star in his career while also being nominated for the NBA All&ndash;Star skills challenge. Again that year they made it to
			the playoffs but lost to the Washington Wizards in the first round. In the 2016 season&sbquo; Lowry was at his peak becoming a 2&ndash;time All&ndash;Star and taking the 
			Raptors to the Eastern Conference Finals where they lost to the dominant <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Cleveland-Cavaliers" class="red"> 
			Cleveland Cavaliers</a> in a 6 game series. Lowry continued to be a star in 2017 getting his 4th All&ndash;Star selection while also taking the Raptors to the playoffs
			where they lost again to the Cleveland Cavaliers but this time in the second round. Fast&ndash;forwarding 2 years later to the 2019 season which in my opinion was 
			Lowry&rsquo;s best season ever. That year Lowry had got his 5th All&ndash;Star selection and was an important asset for Toronto&rsquo;s first&ndash;ever NBA championship 
			title.</p>
		<h3> Team 4: Miami Heat </h3> <!-- The information about Lowry on the Miami Heat may change with future seasons -->
		<p> Lowry was traded to the Miami Heat in August 2021 in exchange for Goran Dragic and Precious Achiuwa. So far half of the 2021/2022 season is done and Lowry has averages of
			13 points&sbquo; 5 rebounds and 8 assists a game. He has also helped the heat to maintain the first seed in the Eastern Conference.
