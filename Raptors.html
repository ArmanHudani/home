		<h2 id="TheHistory" class="ball">The History</h2>
		<h3> 1998-2010 </h3> <!-- This section will give the website viewers a short history about the Raptors franchise -->
		<p>	The Toronto Raptors are a professional <a href="index.html" class="red">basketball</a> team that are situated 
			in Toronto&sbquo; Ontario. They are the only Canadian based team left in the NBA in the after the exit of the Vancouver
			Grizzles in the 2000/2001 season. The Raptors were first called the Toronto Huskies when they used to play for the 
			<a href="https://basketball.fandom.com/wiki/Basketball_Association_of_America" class="red">BAA</a>.
			The raptors got their first break when they acquired one of the best players in NBA history <a href="https://vincecarter15.com/bio/" 
			class="red">Vince Carter</a> in the 1998 draft. The raptors first reached the playoffs in the 1999/2000 season and did 
			it again in the 2000/2001 season where they went all the way to the semi-finals only to lose to the Philadelphia 76ers who 
			ironically move on to win the Championship. After going to the playoffs next season they had a long 4 year drought of having 
			terrible seasons and many blame this on the raptors decision to trade Vince Carter in the 2004 season. They regained power in 
			the 2007 season by going to the playoffs with the number 4th pick of the 2003 draft&sbquo; Chris Bosh. Their power only lasted
			for a short while as they exited the playoffs in the first round in this season and the next season. Due to quick losses in the 
			playoffs&sbquo; the raptor&rsquo;s star Chris Bosh left the team for the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Miami-Heat" 
			class="red">Miami Heat</a> for stars such as Lebron James and Dwayne Wade in the 2010 free agency. </p>
		<h3> 2014-Present </h3>
		<p>	In the 2014/2015 season&sbquo; the raptors for the third time in their history were first in the Eastern Conference but lost in the first round of the playoffs. The 
			next season was one to remeber for the raptors as they won 56 games which was a record for them and this was lead by stars 
			<a href="KyleLowry.html" class="red">Kyle Lowry</a> and <a href="https://sportytell.com/basketball/demar-derozan-biography-facts-childhood-net-worth-life/" 
			class="red">DeMar DeRozan</a>. This was also the year that they reached the Eastern Conference finals for the first time but were 
			eliminated by the eventual champions the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Cleveland-Cavaliers" class="red">Cleveland Cavaliers</a>.
			The next season was a mediocre season for the raptors going to the playoffs but again falling short to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the second round.
			The 2017/2018 season was another milestone for the raptors as they recorded 59 games won beating their previous record of 56 victories. Like always 
			the raptors lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the second round of the playoffs. After many losses in the playoffs&sbquo; the raptor&rsquo;s decided
			to make a significant trade by trading DeMar DeRozan for the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/San-Antonio-Spurs" class="red"> 
			San Antonio Spur&rsquo;s</a> <a href="https://sportytell.com/biography/kawhi-leonard-biography-facts-childhood-personal-life/" class="red">
			Kawhi Leonard</a>. This turned out to be the best decision the raptors had made as they won the NBA title that same year which was their first one
			in the history of the team. Fast Forwarding to the prsent&sbquo; the raptors have had a playoff apearence but are now mostly focused with rebuilding the team after
			trading veteran Kyle Lowry and acquiring young players such as Socttie Barnes and Precious Achiuwa. A little more than half of the 2021/2022 season is over and the 
			raptors are currently 7th in the Eastern Conference trying to keep their playoff dreams alive. </p>

		<!-- This is a short and sweet overview informing the viewers of the website on how the franchise got their name -->
		<p> The Toronto &ldquo;Raptors&rdquo; was a name that was chosen by a fan. It all started in 1994 when the organization asked fans to choose names
			for the team and then submit them. The top 10 options were Raptors&sbquo; Bobcats&sbquo; Dragons&sbquo; Terriers&sbquo; Tarantulas&sbquo; T-Rex&sbquo; 
			Scorpions&sbquo; Hogs&sbquo; Beavers&sbquo; and Grizzles. The reason why the &ldquo;Raptors&rdquo; was chosen as the name was because of the hit movie
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film)" class="red">Jurassic Park</a> which was directed by one of the most successful director
			Steven Spielberg. The orginization announced the name change on May 15th and had instantly a bunch of fan support towards the name. The logo created to 
			accompany the name was a large dinosaur bouncing a basktball to represent a raptor. Some of the colors that made up the logo were naismith silver which was to
			represent the inventor of basketball and who was also Canadian <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/James-Naismith" class="red">James Naismith</a>&sbquo;
			red&sbquo; black&sbquo; and purple. </p>
